#wordnet-to-sqlite

A utility for parsing the wordnet files into an sqlite database 
using Node.js. 

## Install it on node from npm

`npm install wordnet-to-sqlite`

## Usage

I don't advise you use this quite yet. It doesn't work. All it can do is parse 
the `data.` files into an array of objects. I'm planning on parsing the 
`index.` files next, and then building a database after that.
